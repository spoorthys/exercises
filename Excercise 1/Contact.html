The history of meditation is intimately bound up with the religious context within which it was practiced.[20] Even in prehistoric times civilizations used repetitive, rhythmic chants and offerings to appease the gods.[21] Some authors have even suggested the hypothesis that the emergence of the capacity for focused attention, an element of many methods of meditation,[22] may have contributed to the final phases of human biological evolution.[23] Some of the earliest references to meditation are found in the Bible, dating around 1400 BCE,[24][25] and in the Hindu Vedas from around the 15th century BCE.[20] Around the 6th to 5th centuries BCE, other forms of meditation developed in Taoist China and Buddhist India.[20]

In the west, by 20BCE Philo of Alexandria had written on some form of "spiritual exercises" involving attention (prosoche) and concentration[26] and by the 3rd century Plotinus had developed meditative techniques.

The Pāli Canon, which dates to 1st century BCE considers Indian Buddhist meditation as a step towards salvation.[27] By the time Buddhism was spreading in China, the Vimalakirti Sutra which dates to 100CE included a number of passages on meditation, clearly pointing to Zen.[28] The Silk Road transmission of Buddhism introduced meditation to other oriental countries, and in 653 the first meditation hall was opened in Japan.[29] Returning from China around 1227, Dōgen wrote the instructions for Zazen.[30][31]

The Islamic practice of Dhikr had involved the repetition of the 99 Names of God since the 8th or 9th century.[32][33] By the 12th century, the practice of Sufism included specific meditative techniques, and its followers practiced breathing controls and the repetition of holy words.[34] Interactions with Indians or the Sufis may have influenced the Eastern Christian meditation approach to hesychasm, but this can not be proved.[35][36] Between the 10th and 14th centuries, hesychasm was developed, particularly on Mount Athos in Greece, and involves the repetition of the Jesus prayer.[37]</h5>
